## Main Concepts Applied
Created a simple landing page with a navigation bar and product grid layout. Used HTML for structure and linked an external CSS file for styling.

## New Skills Acquired
Learned how to build a basic product display page with images and descriptions. Also, linked icons for social media and added navigation with `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I learned how to structure a product page and use external stylesheets for layout and design.
Challenges Faced
Image Size Issues: Had to resize images a few times to make them fit properly in the grid.
Navigation Errors: At first, I forgot to close the nav tag properly. It caused some display issues, but I fixed it by adding the missing tag.

## Clarity & Coherence
I kept it simple and didnâ€™t over-explain, sticking to the important points only.
