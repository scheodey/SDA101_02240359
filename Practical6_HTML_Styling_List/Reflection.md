## Main Concepts Applied
I used ordered lists `(<ol>)` and nested unordered lists `(<ul>)` to structure the events. I also added some basic CSS to make the list items bold and change color when hovered over.

## New Skills Acquired
I got to practice styling lists and making them interactive with the hover effect. I also got better at using CSS to target specific classes for styling.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I learned how to organize different events into categories using nested lists and how to make those lists stand out with simple styles. The hover effect was a nice addition too.

## Challenges Faced
Indentation Issues: The nested list looked weird at first because of incorrect indentation. Fixed it by properly nesting the `<ul>` under the corresponding `<li>`.
Style Confusion: The hover effect didnâ€™t work right away, I had to check that I added the class correctly to all list items.

## Clarity & Coherence
I kept it simple and to the point. I feel like this explains the code and the issues I faced clearly without going overboard.
