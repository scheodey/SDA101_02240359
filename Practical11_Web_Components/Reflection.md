## Main Concepts Applied
I created a custom card component using Web Components with shadow DOM and slots. The card lets you dynamically add content like a header, body, and footer. It also supports styling through attributes like background colors.

## New Skills Acquired
I learned how to build a custom HTML element and use the shadow DOM for encapsulating styles and content. The slots feature was cool because it allows me to place custom content in predefined areas.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
Building this custom card was an awesome learning experience! I understood how to make a reusable component, which can be customized using attributes and slots. It's a great way to make modular, scalable web components.
Challenges Faced
Shadow DOM: At first, I had some trouble understanding how the shadow DOM works. I realized that any styles or content added to the main document wouldn't affect the card due to the shadow boundary.
Slot Usage: I struggled a bit with slot placement and didn’t realize that slot content needs to be inside a slot tag.

## Clarity & Coherence
I tried to make it easy to follow, but I could’ve explained some parts like observedAttributes better, as I was still wrapping my head around it. Also, I didn’t realize that slotting an image needs a slot="content" tag.
