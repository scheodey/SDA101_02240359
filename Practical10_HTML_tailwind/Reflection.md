## Main Concepts Applied
Built a simple webpage using Tailwind CSS for styling. Added a hover effect for a button using custom CSS. Also used Flexbox for centering the content.

## New Skills Acquired
Learned how to use Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design. Also, added interactive button hover effects with CSS transitions.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I learned how to make a webpage with a clean design using Tailwind CSS. Also, experimenting with button hover effects was fun!

## Challenges Faced
CSS Issue: The button hover effect was too intense at first. Had to adjust the scale and color to make it less jarring.
Layout Problem: Initially, the page was not centered properly, but using flex solved the issue.

## Clarity & Coherence
I kept it brief and clear without overcomplicating the explanation.
