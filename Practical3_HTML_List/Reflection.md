## Main Concepts Applied
I used basic HTML tags like `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<h2>` to organize the content properly. I also nested lists under "Study Goals" and added a `<meta>` tag to make the page responsive for different devices.

## New Skills Acquired
I got better at working with ordered and unordered lists together and also learned how important the viewport settings are for mobile-friendly designs.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
This exercise really helped me get better at structuring HTML. I also learned a lot about making pages more readable and how to improve responsiveness using simple changes.

## Challenges Faced
Meta Tag Error: I added a wrong character in the `<meta>` tag, and it didn’t work properly. I fixed it by removing the extra backslash.
Nested List Issue: My nested lists didn’t show up correctly at first because of wrong indentation, but I managed to fix it by adjusting spacing.

## Clarity & Coherence
I tried to keep my reflection simple and to the point. It’s not perfect, but I think it explains what I learned and the challenges I had.
