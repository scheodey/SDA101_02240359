## Main Concepts Applied
Used a table to display grades for different modules, with columns for assignment name, marks, percentage, and grade. Applied CSS for styling via an external file.

## New Skills Acquired
Got better at structuring tables with `<th>` and `<td>`. Also practiced using external stylesheets to apply design rules.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I learned how to create tables to organize data, and how to link an external stylesheet for styling.

Challenges Faced
Missing Data: I didn't add total marks or calculations for percentage at first. Had to figure that out manually.
Table Styling: Took a bit of time to get the design right, but adding classes for styling helped make it clearer.

## Clarity & Coherence
Kept the reflection brief and easy to understand,and to the point.
