### Styling table
Create an HTML table to keep track of your grades throughout the semester. You should list all your modules, assignments, exams, and their respective scores. The table should include the following columns:

* Module
* Assignment/Exam Name
* Maximum Marks
* Marks Obtained
* Percentage
* Grade

Example: Module: "SDA101" - Assignment 1: "Figma Design" - Max Marks: 10 - Marks Obtained: 7 - Percentage: 70% - Grade: B
