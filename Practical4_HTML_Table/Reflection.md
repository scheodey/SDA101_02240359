## Main Concepts Applied
I used HTML tables to create the weekly schedule. Elements like `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` were used for structure. CSS was added to style borders, backgrounds, and alignment. I also used colspan to merge cells for the "Lunch Break" row.

## New Skills Acquired
I got better at working with HTML tables and learned how colspan helps merge columns. Styling tables with CSS was also something I got to practice more.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I learned how to make tables look better and more organized using CSS. Using a `<caption>` for the table title was also something new I hadn’t focused on before.

## Challenges Faced
Row Styling Issues: I had trouble with alternating background colors because I missed setting the style for one row. Fixed it by checking each row properly.
Colspan Mistake: The colspan didn’t work initially because I put the wrong value. I realized the mistake and corrected it to match the table structure.

## Clarity & Coherence
I tried to keep this reflection simple and clear. It explains what I learned and the issues I ran into.
