## Introduction
In this individual assignment, your task is to replicate five key pages of the given digital platform using design systems in Figma.

A design system in Figma is a comprehensive set of reusable components, styles, and guidelines
that work together to create a cohesive and consistent design language for digital products. It
includes standardized UI elements like buttons, icons, and form fields, along with defined color
palettes, typography, and spacing rules.

You will demonstrate your understanding of component design, implement a design system, show case your proficiency with the tool, and ensure functional accuracy in your replication.

## Project Overview

You will replicate a specified digital platform using component design systems. This involves the following steps:

 1. Analyze the assigned platform, paying close attention to its component design system.
 2. Identify and catalog the key components used across the platform.
 3. Design and build these components, ensuring consistency and reusability.
 4. Implement the design system, including color schemes, typography, and other design
  elements.
 5. Use your components to recreate key pages or screens from the original platform.
 6. Apply your understanding of the platform's functionality to ensure accurate representation.
 7. Ensure your design is responsive to different screen sizes.
 8. Review and refine your work, paying attention to details and consistency.
 9. Organize your file neatly, with well-named layers and a clear component structure.
