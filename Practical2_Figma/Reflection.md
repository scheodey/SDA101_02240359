(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied:
HTML Structure: I organized the webpage using tags like <header>, <nav>, and <footer> for better structure, though I’m still getting used to making everything fully semantic.
External Resources: I linked external CSS for styling and Font Awesome for icons, which was helpful to make things look nicer and more functional.
Responsive Design: Tried to make the layout adaptable to different screens, though I didn’t implement full media queries yet (still need to figure that part out).
New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
I got better at structuring pages and using external resources like libraries and images. I also learned more about integrating icons and other design elements into a webpage.

(b) Reflection
What I Learned:
I learned how to better organize my HTML to make things clear and easier to navigate. I also learned how to add interactive elements like buttons and search bars to make the page more engaging.
Challenges Faced:
External Resources: The Font Awesome icons didn’t show up at first, which was frustrating.
Solution: I double-checked the links and made sure everything was connected properly.
Image Alignment: Some of the images weren’t aligning correctly in the "proj" section.
Solution: I had to adjust the CSS a bit and use flexbox to get them lined up right.

(c) Clarity & Coherence
I tried to keep the reflection simple and to the point. It’s definitely not perfect, but I think it covers the main concepts and what I learned in a clear way.
