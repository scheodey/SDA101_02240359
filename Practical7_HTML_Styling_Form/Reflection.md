## Main Concepts Applied
I used `<input>` and `<select>` to get details for the maintenance form. Included fields like room number and urgency.

## New Skills Acquired
Learned how to use dropdowns `(<select>)` for options like urgency and room numbers. Got better at using required to make sure important fields are filled.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I got better at building forms and using select dropdowns for giving choices.

## Challenges Faced
Missing Names: Forgot to add name for some fields like room number and urgency but have fixed it later.
I used `<input>` for description, but it was too small for writing description . Shouldâ€™ve used `<textarea>`.

## Clarity & Coherence
I kept it simple and to the point.
