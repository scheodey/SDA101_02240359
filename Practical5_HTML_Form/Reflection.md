## Main Concepts Applied
Used HTML form tags like `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<select>` to build a seminar registration form. Added types like email, date, radio, etc., to collect different kinds of data.

## New Skills Acquired
Got more familiar with form inputs, especially using required to make sure fields get filled out. Learned how to group radio buttons with the same name attribute.

## Reflection
Key Learnings
I learned a lot about how forms work and how to make sure people fill in what’s needed. Using different input types like email and password made it easier to collect data.

## Challenges Faced
Missing name for Radio Buttons: At first, the radio buttons for gender didn’t work because I forgot to add name. Fixed it by adding it to all buttons.
Dropdown Issue: The `<select>` box wasn’t showing right at first, but it was a browser default thing, so I left it alone.

## Clarity & Coherence
Kept it short and simple. Hopefully explains everything without going into too much detail.
